# ULI101 - Introduction to UNIX/LINUX & Internet

This repository contains all of my code programs and work which I performed in the above mentioned course.

Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * learn Unix and Linux representing the operating system technology underlying many of
    the services of the Internet.
  * introduce to Unix, Linux and the Internet.
  * learn the core utilities to work productively in a Linux environment. 
  * work using the shell, at the same time learn to configure their login accounts, manipulate
    data stored in files, effectively use Linux commands and utilities, and write simple shell scripts.
  * Execute Linux commands to manage files and directories.
  * Edit text files using common text editors in order to configure the system and write scripts.
  * Write shell scripts to solve programming problems, including customizing user environments to
    improve working efficiency.
  * Describe the directory layout of a typical Linux system in order to maintain and secure Unix
    directories and files. 5. Use Linux pipes and file redirection to manipulate data.
  * Form simple regular expressions to define patterns.
  * Communicate clearly, concisely and correctly in the written, spoken and visual form
    that fulfils the purpose and meets the needs of the audience.
  * Respond to written, spoken, or visual messages in a manner that ensures effective communication.
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.
  * Gained a handsome knowledge on all of the topics of UNIX/ LINUX & the Internet namely-

I declare that all the code/commands/ work in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of UNIX/Linux Command Scripts and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
